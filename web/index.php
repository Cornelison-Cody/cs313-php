            <p> My wife, Kristin, and I have been married for five years now. We
                met while I was serving a mission in Las Vegas, NV. We have two
                children. Oliver is 3, and Carter is 1. We now live in Washington
                where we are enjoying family close by. We love to hang out,
                play board games, and laugh with each other. There is never a
                dull moment at our house.</p>
